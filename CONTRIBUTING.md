## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request:

1. Check [existing issues](https://github.com/thiagomvas/LogPort/issues) to see if it’s already reported.
2. If not, create a new issue with:

   * A descriptive title
   * Steps to reproduce (for bugs) or expected behavior (for features)
   * Screenshots or logs if helpful

Issues are the best way to start a conversation before you begin working.

## Proposing Changes

Before writing code:

1. **Create an issue first** describing what you want to do.
2. Discuss and get feedback — this saves wasted effort and ensures your work aligns with project goals.

## Pull Request Process

We follow **trunk-based development**, so here’s the workflow:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your change:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```
3. Make your changes and commit with clear messages.
4. Push your branch to your fork.
5. Open a pull request (PR) against the `master` branch of the main repo.
6. Link the PR to the relevant issue.
7. A maintainer will review, provide feedback, and merge once approved.
