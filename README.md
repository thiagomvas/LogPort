**Logport** is a self-hosted log aggregation and analytics platform designed to be the central **port** for all your application logs.

Just like a real port connects ships from around the world, Logport connects logs from every corner of your system 
from lightweight services to enterprise-scale applications and brings them together in one place for analysis and insight.
